Location Privacy Framework for CyanogenMOd 10.1 -- TODO
=======================================================

done:

* use packageName in db, but show application label in UI



todo NEEDED:

* check obfuscation results again

* obfuscate extraLocation of an Location when obfuscating
  a location. Should use the same algo, values AND random values
  to obfuscate location and its extra location the same way.

* check Proximity and Geofence obfuscation

* fix MapView of fixed location picker
  it flickers, hangs and wastes cpu, or else only on CM 10.1



todo maybe:

* add multi-user support?
  each user should have his own configurations in the db
  or his own db file in his personl storage?
  include user id or similar in db?
