Location Privacy Framework for CyanogenMOd 10.1 -- TODO
=======================================================

done:

* use packageName in db, but show application label in UI


todo NEEDED:

* obfuscate extraLocation of an Location when obfuscating
  a location. Should use the same algorithm, values AND random values
  to obfuscate location and its extra location the same way.

* check Proximity and Geofence obfuscation


todo maybe:

* add multi-user support?
  each user should have his own configurations in the db
  or his own db file in his personl storage?
  include user id or similar in db?
