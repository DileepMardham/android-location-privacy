* app A is removed
  Settings is not used, hence configuration is not deleted
  app B is installed
  app B gets the uid of old app A
  app B is used
  => app B uses location privacy settings of app A
  => Settings keeps name of app A

  ==> always compare uid and app/package name OR change install/registration


* if app is added to configuration, app name in current language is used
  => name in Settings does not change if language is changed

  ==> save package name on configuration and retrieve app name dynamically


* fix switch bug and remove redraw workarond
  switching location privacy switch in Settings also switches BT
